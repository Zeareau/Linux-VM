# Linux-VM
- Hosted a Linux Virtual Machine on my PC to teach myself Linux Terminal Prompts using Ubuntu distro
- Configured MSI motherboard to allocate computing resources and storage to co-host VM VirtualBox software


## What I Did

- Created a Virtual Machine using **VirtualBox** and installed the **Ubuntu** distribution.
- Allocated system resources (CPU, RAM, disk) through my **MSI motherboard BIOS** to ensure smooth VM performance.
- Practiced core **Linux terminal commands** to build familiarity with bash scripting and system navigation.
- Installed essential tools like `git`, `curl`, `vim`, and `build-essential` using `apt`.
- Took screenshots to document progress and system setup.

## Commands I Practiced

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git curl vim build-essential
neofetch
curl https://example.com
